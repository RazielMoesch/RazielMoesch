I like naming things weird things sometimes so take the naming schemes in my repos with a grain of salt. Working towards creating a toolset people actually wanna use.
So far i've rebuilt the transformers library in python or at the very least enough to train a small model. 

PS if you want to give me a job email me at therazielmoesch@gmail.com
